# Indian-Road-Condition-Dataset-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Road-Anomaly-Detection


**Project Description**
This project aims to detect road anomalies such as potholes, road conditions, and speed bumps using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of images of Indian roads that are analyzed using various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to identify these anomalies. The project uses the MobileNetV2, EfficientNet-B0, and ResNet50 models to classify road conditions and detect anomalies. The ResNet50 model, which outperforms the others, is the focus of the comparison in this project.
